# Plotly

## Purpose

The purpose of this task was to create complete dashboard that can be used by the volunteers to access data that has been gathered. The volunteers can access the data using the website below, where they are presented with three charts that summarize the data. Using these charts, the volunteers are able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. Using this data, the volunteers are able to identify weather a bacterial species is found in their navel.

## Dashboard
